# python scripts for internal and external validation

#Instruction
There are 5 steps in total to do interonal and external validation for the residual model in Python. 
The validation results are some .csv files, which will be summarized and visualized in R.
These 5 steps include:
step 1. subset "X_pos.fcs", "X_neg.fcs" and "X_sample.fcs" files from each single color control .fcs files.
step 2. use subset files to calculate parameters for Residual Model.
step 3. Again, subset stable cell populations for later justice validation.
step 4. internal validation.
step 5. external validation.
